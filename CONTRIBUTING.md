## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[GDI User Portal Front-end Code of Conduct](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/gdi-userportal-dataset-discovery-service/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <>.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the
> available [Documentation](https://genomicdatainfrastructure.github.io/gdi-userportal-docs/).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for
existing [Issues](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/gdi-userportal-dataset-discovery-service/issues) that
might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in
this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/gdi-userportal-dataset-discovery-service/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to
investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the
following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment
  components/versions (Make sure that you have read
  the [documentation](https://genomicdatainfrastructure.github.io/gdi-userportal-docs/). If you are looking for support,
  you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there
  is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in
  the [bug tracker](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/gdi-userportal-dataset-discovery-service/labels/bug)
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have
  discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue
> tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <>.

<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/gdi-userportal-dataset-discovery-service/issues/new). (
  Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to
  label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to
  recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem
  and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no
  obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs
  with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such
  as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for GDI User Portal Front-end, **including
completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help
maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://genomicdatainfrastructure.github.io/gdi-userportal-docs/) carefully and find out if
  the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/gdi-userportal-dataset-discovery-service/issues) to
  see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a
  new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to
  convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be
  useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users,
  consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked
as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/gdi-userportal-dataset-discovery-service/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point
  you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most GDI User Portal Front-end users. You may also want to point
  out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

3. **Configure environment variables**: The project may require certain environment variables to be set. Check the
   project documentation or ask the project team for the required variables and their values.

4. **Set up your IDE**: Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We are using VSCode
   with the following extensions:

- Extension Pack for Java
- OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor
- REST Client
- Quarkus
- Java Google Format
